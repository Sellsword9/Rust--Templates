# You can use any of the code of any of the repos for free with or without attributing me. Use it as you want.

## Templates: 
1. ### Actix-Basic: This repo contains basic Actix syntax that i personally use for every Actix dummy project I start
2. ### MySQLConnections: This repo was harder that I thought to make. I use MySQL a lot, but apparently not a lot of people does too. POSTRE is far more used from what i have seen
3. ### Json-Server: This repo is for using json-server and node in general with an Actix server. It was made just for sole purpose of being able to run JavaScript without something like Vite, just for fun
